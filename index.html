              When the kingdom's most wanted—and most charming—bandit, Flynn
              Rider (Zachary Levi), hides out in a mysterious tower, he's taken
              hostage by Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), a beautiful and feisty
              tower-bound teen with 70 feet of magical, golden hair. Flynn's
              curious captor, who's looking for her ticket out of the tower
              where she's been locked away for years, strikes a deal with the
              handsome thief, and the unlikely duo sets off on an action-packed
              escapade, complete with a super-cop horse (Maximus), an
              over-protective chameleon (Pascal), and a gruff gang of pub thugs.
